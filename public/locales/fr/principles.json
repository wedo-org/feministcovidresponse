    "Principles": "Les principes",
    "Key Principles for Feminist Response to": "Les principes clés de la réponse féministe au",
    "Cross-cutting to all these principles is the promotion, protection and fulfillment of human rights and gender equality.": "La promotion, la protection et l’accomplissement des droits de l’homme et de l’égalité des sexes sont des éléments transversaux à tous ces principes.",
    "Human rights and their fundamental principles, including the principles of universality, inalienability, interdependence, indivisiblity, equality, non-discrimination, non-derogation and accountability, must guide all actions taken in response to COVID-19. This includes collective rights, such as the rights of Indigenous Peoples, migrant, displaced and refugee populations as well as labour rights. While restrictions on some rights in the context of the current public health emergency may be warranted, any measures must be necessary, proportionate to the current risk, have a specific time and duration, and be applied in a non-discriminatory way. Further, the current crisis must not be used to promote stigmatization, discrimination and hate speech, nor silence dissent or protest, attack human rights and environmental defenders, especially women human rights defenders, or undermine the exercise of other rights, like sexual and reproductive rights.  The response to COVID-19 must be gender-responsive and advance gender equality, and must ensure the fulfillment of women’s human rights as recognized in international treaties and agreements.": "Les droits de l’homme et leurs principes fondamentaux, notamment les principes d’universalité, d’inaliénabilité, d’interdépendance, d’indivisibilité, d’égalité, de non-discrimination, de non-dérogation et de responsabilité, doivent guider chaque action entreprise pour lutter contre le COVID-19. Cela inclut les droits collectifs, comme les droits des peuples indigènes, des populations migrantes, déplacées et réfugiées, mais aussi les droits des travailleurs. Si la restriction de certains droits peut être justifiée dans un tel contexte d’urgence sanitaire, ces mesures doivent être nécessaires. Elles doivent être appliquées proportionnellement aux risques actuels, de manière non discriminatoire et limitée. La crise actuelle ne doit pas être utilisée pour promouvoir la stigmatisation, la discrimination et les discours de haine, pour faire taire les voix dissidentes, les protestations, pour porter atteinte aux défenseurs des droits de l’homme, de l’environnement et des femmes, ou pour compromettre l’exercice d’autres droits, comme la liberté sexuelle et génésique. Les mesures de lutte contre le COVID-19 doivent se faire dans le respect de tous les genres et faire progresser l’égalité des sexes, elles doivent garantir les droits des femmes reconnus dans les traités et accords internationaux. ",
    "COVID-19 responses must centre the well-being of all people in an intersectional manner.": "Les mesures de lutte contre le COVID-19 doivent se concentrer sur le bien-être de tous ",
    "Any measure to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 should be centered around the well-being of all people, both at the individual and the collective level. Responses must take into consideration the multi-dimensional and intersecting forms of inequalities, discrimination and marginalisation that puts particular groups of people at increased risk. This includes": "Toute mesure visant à atténuer les effets du COVID-19 doit être centrée sur le bien-être de tous, tant au niveau individuel que collectif. Ces mesures doivent prendre en considération les formes multidimensionnelles et croisées d’inégalités, de discrimination et de marginalisation qui exposent certains groupes de personnes à un risque accru. Elles doivent inclure",
    "Recognizing multiple and intersecting discrimination (such as on the basis of sex, age, race, ethnicity, economic status, geographic status, religion, migration status, disability, sexual orientation and gender identity, expression and sex characteristics, and others) may increase the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on specific population groups and communities; that women, men and gender non-conforming people within these groups will have different experiences and needs; and develop specific strategies to mitigate and address them.": "La reconnaissance des discriminations multiples (fondées notamment sur l’âge, la race, l’origine ethnique, la situation économique, le statut géographique, la religion, l’indigénéité, le statut migratoire, le handicap, l’orientation sexuelle, l’identité de genre, l’expression et les caractéristiques sexuelles) pouvant accroître l’impact de la pandémie COVID-19 sur certaines populations et communautés ; le fait que les femmes, les hommes et les personnes d’autres genres au sein de ces groupes auront des expériences et des besoins différents. Nous devons donc élaborer des stratégies qui permettront d’atténuer ces discriminations et de répondre aux besoins de chacun.  ",
    "Collecting and analyzing disaggregated data so that decision-makers at all levels can take proactive measures to prioritize and target mitigation and response measures to those most affected and those at heightened risk of infection and mortality.": "La collecte et l’analyse de données ventilées afin que les décideurs puissent, à tous les niveaux, prendre des mesures proactives pour hiérarchiser et cibler les mesures d’atténuation et d’intervention sur les personnes les plus touchées et les plus exposées au risque d’infection et de mortalité. Toute mesure visant à atténuer les effets du COVID-19 devrait être centrée sur le bien-être des personnes, tant au niveau individuel que collectif.",
    "Reinforcing and expanding social protection systems to include the informal sector, including micro entrepreneurs and self-employed people, especially the most precarious in domestic, care and services work, including sex workers,  to ensure that all people have access to a universal basic income, paid leave, food, and caregiving services.": "Renforcer et étendre les systèmes de protection sociale pour y inclure l’économie informelle, les microentreprises, les travailleurs indépendants, et plus particulièrement les personnes les plus précaires, que ce soit dans le domaine des services, comme les services domestiques, les soins médicaux ou les travailleurs et travailleuses du sexe, afin de garantir que tout le monde ait accès à un revenu de base universel, aux congés payés, à la nourriture et aux services de soins.",
    "Specific actions to identify, protect the rights of, and respond to the needs of marginalized and excluded communities in COVID-19 responses, including people with disabilities, racial or ethnic minorities, indigenous people, displaced and refugees, migrants, older people, LGBTI people, people living with HIV/AIDs and those affected by poverty, as well as people who are in detention, incarcerated or in institutional settings.": "Des actions spécifiques permettant d’identifier, de protéger les droits et de répondre aux besoins des communautés marginalisées et exclues, comme les personnes handicapées, les minorités raciales ou ethniques, les populations autochtones, les personnes déplacées, les réfugiés, les migrants, les personnes âgées, les personnes LGBTI, les personnes vivant avec le VIH/sida et celles touchées par la pauvreté, mais aussi les personnes en détention ou dans tout type de cadre institutionnel.",
    "Action to address increases in xenophobia and racism, avoid rhetoric that fuels discrimination, politicizes the pandemic for political gain or that stokes fear, and ensure that COVID-19 responses do not increase violence or discrimination against certain populations.": "Des actions qui permettent de faire face à la montée de la xénophobie et du racisme, mais aussi de minimiser les discours qui alimentent la discrimination et la peur afin de politiser cette pandémie. Grâce à ces actions, nous pourrons nous assurer que les mesures prises pour lutter contre le COVID-19 ne provoquent pas la violence ou la discrimination d’une certaine partie de la population.",
    "Specific actions to fulfill the right to information, including by ensuring that information about the pandemic is available in different languages and formats accessible to people with disabilities, illiterate, and those lacking access to digital spaces while  ensuring the broadest possible access to the internet.": "Des actions spécifiques permettant de garantir le droit à l’information, notamment en veillant à ce que les informations sur la pandémie soient disponibles dans différentes langues, dans différents formats accessibles aux personnes handicapées, aux analphabètes et aux personnes qui n’ont pas accès aux espaces numériques, tout en garantissant l’accès le plus large possible à Internet.",
    "COVID-19 responses must ensure the health and safety of all, including ensuring sexual and reproductive health and rights": "Les mesures prises face au COVID-19 doivent protéger la santé et la sécurité de tous, mais aussi les droits sexuels et génésiques des personnes",
    
    
    "There can be no effective response to a public health crisis that does not center gender equality and vice versa. We are witnessing attacks on the human rights of women, girls, and gender non-conforming people by further restricting abortion, access to comprehensive sexuality education, and gender-affirming treatment.
